## What this project is
GentSampler is a 16-pad flip sampler VST3 (+ Standalone) for Windows, built on
JUCE 8. Drop a track in → auto BPM/key detection → transient cue points →
tempo-synced time-stretch (Signalsmith Stretch) → play/flip on 16 pads → get
work OUT (drag slices as WAV, performances as MIDI, kit export, clearance-ready
Flip Log). v2 work in progress: AI stem separation via ONNX Runtime
(htdemucs_6s) and Basic Pitch audio-to-MIDI transcription. "Shipped" = builds
clean, passes pluginval, and runs stable inside FL Studio.

## Current state (inferred from GENTSAMPLER_AUDIT.md 2026-06-28 and GPU_HANDOFF.md 2026-06-25 — correct me)
- Last completed: Redesign Phase C, Task C3 — the Slice Detail strip is live and
  FUNCTIONAL. Hero reclaimed its mockup-true 160px (was 196, parking C3's budget);
  new 60px strip added below it (SliceDetailStrip, PluginEditor.h) with a left meta
  plate (PAD n . STEM in the pad's stem hue), a centre zoomed wave (+-15% context,
  transient ticks, dim-outside-region, granular freeze marker, live playhead), and
  right CUE/END/LEN mono readouts. CUE drags call the exact same p.setCue(...,
  snap=true). END-handle drags on BOTH surfaces now call one shared helper,
  applyEndHandleDrag() (PluginEditor.h, just above WaveformView) — a post-review
  extraction that replaced a duplicated decision tree: each surface converts its
  own ~8px collapse affordance into sample-space tolerance at its OWN current zoom
  (samplesPerPixel x 8) and passes that in; the helper does the collapse check,
  SNAP branch, and min-length clamp exactly once. Open/gated slices show an OPEN
  tag; dragging the END handle inward converts them via the existing
  collapse/expand semantics. Pad grid reflowed back
  toward its mockup proportions with the height C3 gave back. Fixed the stems-lanes
  h>180 gate (dead at the new fixed 160px hero) — now gates on content only, with the
  never-in-the-mockup top ruler dropped in stems view and the band-height floor
  raised 56->78 so lanes/mute/solo stay legible and hittable.
- In progress: Nothing live — C3 built+verified (build clean, pluginval strictness 5
  SUCCESS); holding for sign-off before C4 (selection/state plumbing polish) and the
  C5 gate.
- Next up: Phase C4 — confirm strip follows selection/source-hue changes and repaints
  from either edit surface with zero drift; add the strip to the editor's timer
  sweep review; then the C5 sign-off gate (FL screenshots, functional-check list).
- Blocked on: host-process CUDA integration fault (see GPU_HANDOFF.md §3).

## Conventions
- Language/stack: C++17, JUCE 8.0.4 (FetchContent), CMake ≥3.22,
  MSVC (VS 2022 Build Tools), x64, Windows. MSVC `/utf-8` enforced.
- Style: Formatter: clang-format (config in .clang-format at repo root). Match existing code style in Source/.
- Tests: none — the build is the machine gate; pluginval is the second gate
  when installed. The reviewer agent is the only check on logic until tests exist.
- Verification command: `cmake --build build --config Release --parallel`
  (gate.sh auto-configures with `cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64` if build/ is missing, then runs pluginval at strictness 5 if it's on PATH)

## Architecture (short)
- Plugin targets: VST3 + Standalone, `IS_SYNTH`, MIDI in, 16 optional per-pad
  stereo output buses. `VST3_AUTO_MANIFEST FALSE` — do not re-enable (skips a
  build-time LoadLibrary step that breaks the one-click build).
- Time-stretch: Signalsmith Stretch (MIT), fetched from `main` — if its API
  drifts, pin a tag in CMakeLists.txt. Master pitch/tempo = true stretch;
  per-pad pitch = classic repitch (by design, MPC-style).
- ONNX Runtime pinned at **1.18.1** (CUDA 11.8/cuDNN 8.9 legacy conv path).
  1.20+ requires the cuDNN-9 frontend which cannot build htdemucs's first conv
  on this GPU; 1.21/1.22 add a CUDA stream regression. Do NOT upgrade ORT
  without reading GPU_HANDOFF.md §2.
- ORT is loaded manually at runtime (no onnxruntime.lib link) so the plugin
  module has zero load-time ORT dependency; only the two small core DLLs are
  copied next to the VST3. CUDA EP + cuDNN are a first-run download
  (ModelDownloader) to keep CPU-only installs small.
- Audio thread reads sample state under SpinLock; 32-voice pool; tempo changes
  re-render in the background. Don't allocate or lock-contend in processBlock.

## Routing
Follow ROUTING.md in the repo root. Summary:
- Fable plans and gates. Sonnet implements. Haiku only does machine-verifiable work.
- Route by verifiability: if nothing automatic catches a failure, minimum Sonnet.
- Two failures at any tier → escalate with failure context attached.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Verification command passes
- [ ] pluginval passes (when installed) — strictness 5
- [ ] Acceptance criteria from the spec checked off
- [ ] No files touched outside the spec
- [ ] CLAUDE.md "Current state" section updated

## Do not
- Do not add dependencies without spec authorization.
- Do not refactor beyond the task's declared scope.
- Do not guess on ambiguous specs — stop and ask.
- Do not upgrade ONNX Runtime past 1.18.1 or flip `kEnableCuda` to true
  without a spec that cites GPU_HANDOFF.md.
- Do not touch build/ by hand — it is generated.

## Known landmines
Running list of past failures and their fixes, so they never recur.
- 2026-06 — ORT 1.22 + cuDNN 9: conv frontend cannot build htdemucs's 343,980-wide
  1-D conv; 1.21/1.22 CUDA stream regression errors at Add nodes → pinned 1.18.1.
- 2026-06 — `CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER` regressed the conv on the 6 GB card → reverted.
- 2026-06 — GPU inference crashes FL Studio's process (works standalone) →
  CUDA gated off; the thread/context + `cudaSetDevice(0)` fix is ALREADY
  implemented and did not fix it — don't re-try it as step 1.
- Unicode in UI strings requires MSVC `/utf-8` (already set) — don't remove it
  or middots/arrows mojibake.
